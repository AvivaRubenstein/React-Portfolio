# React Portfolio

## Description

This project is a portfolio site, designed to demonstrate my skills to potential employers.  It contains an About Me section, a Portfolio section which showcases 6 applications I have built, along with deployed links and the links to the GitHub repositories for those projects.  It also contains a Resume section in which my technical skills are listed, and a downloadable version of my resume is available, as well as a Contact section for potential employers or collaborators to reach out to me.
Through building this application, I developed my skills working with React to create the front-end or client-side of a website.  This included practicing creating and nesting React components, passing props (or properties) into those components and utilizing them there, and designing elements to be conditionally rendered with React.  I used the React useState Hook to create and update State variables.  I also learned about the syntax required to add functionality and styling to React components in JSX.  

## Installation

To get the development environment running, you can clone this repository and run the "npm install" command in the node terminal to install the project's dependencies.  You can then run the "npm run build" command to build the React application, and "npm run start" to start the React application on your local server.
